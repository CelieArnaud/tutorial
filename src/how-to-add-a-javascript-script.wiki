=How to add a Javacript script?=

If you have client-side programs on your website, you can use Eliom's client-server features, that will compile client side parts to JS using **Ocsigen Js_of_ocaml**. But in some cases you may also want to include external JS scripts.

=== Include the script on the html header

Javascript scripts are included in the header using the **js_script** function.

<<code language="ocaml"|
js_script
     ~uri:(make_uri (Eliom_service.static_dir ())
              ["hello.js"])
     ()
>>
This function has 2 parameters: the file path and unit.

The file path is generated using the **make_uri** function. This function creates the relative URL string using the static directory configured in the configuration file and the given list.

Insert this piece of code on the list given in parameter to the **head** function.

Or you can use:
[[wiki(2):eliom/api/server/Eliom_tools.HTML5_TOOLS#VALhead|Eliom_tools module]]

=== Call an external function

Have a look at
<<a_manual project="js_of_ocaml" chapter="bindings"|this page of Js_of_ocaml's manual>>
to understand how to call JS function from your OCaml program.
