This tutorial will show you how to generate an application template,
with samples of code, that you can use as a demo, to learn Ocsigen,
or as a basis for quickly developing your own minimum viable product.

This template is called [[wiki(81):|Ocsigen Start]].
It has a complete mechanism to create users, with activation links,
reset passwords. It contains a module for displaying tips, a module
to send notifications to your users.
It also contains some code samples that you can use to learn:

* How to do a remote procedure call
* How to save session data (in //Eliom references//)
* How to use the notification system
* How to create a reactive page
* Many example of widgets (from [[wiki(83):|Ocsigen Toolkit]])
** Carousel
** Pages with several tabs
** Time and date picker
* ...

This is a multi-platform client-server application,
that can run on a Web browser or in a mobile app for Android, iOS, or Windows.


Install the dependencies (postgresql, sass or sassc).
On Debian based systems:
{{{
apt-get install postgresql sass
}}}

Install Ocsigen Start and all its OCaml dependencies using Opam:
{{{
opam install ocsigen-start
}}}

Create your application using Eliom distillery:
{{{
eliom-distillery -name myapp -template os.pgocaml
}}}

Have a look at the
[[https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigen-start/blob/master/template.distillery/README.md|README]]
file to learn how to compile it
and, possibly, to generate the mobile applications.

Have fun!
